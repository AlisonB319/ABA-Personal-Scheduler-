Cpt_S 422 Semester Project

Team Members: Alison Burgess, Amariah DelMar, Bobby Belter
Project: Project 2 - Personal Project Scheduler

As stated from the course project pdf:

The project is to develop a tool for individuals working on various projects, helping keep track of
multiple projects and their schedules. The tool allows for adding any number of schedules to be
done for each existing project, and each schedule can be tracked from the start till the end of
the project cycle. Typical details for each schedule include: project for whom the schedule is to
be done, start and end date of the project, total working hours needed and spent already,
current status and percentage of work completed, email notifications to project members (e.g.,
automatically adding a schedule to a memberâ€™s Google calendar).
